# SentientWave Automata

SentientWave Automata helps people and AI agents work together in shared chat rooms.

If your team already runs most work through chat, Automata turns that chat into a reliable operating system for collaboration.

## The Big Idea

Every community and organization needs a collaborative multi-agentic nervous system.

In plain language, that means:
- people and agents see the same context
- requests do not get lost
- long tasks keep running even if services restart
- memory improves over time instead of disappearing in old threads

Automata is built to provide that foundation.

## Who This Is For

- Team leads who want faster execution without adding more tools
- Community managers coordinating humans and assistants in shared rooms
- Operations teams that need reliable, auditable workflows
- Organizations exploring agent collaboration with clear admin control

## What You Can Do With Automata

- Chat with agents directly in Matrix rooms
- Mention an agent and trigger durable workflow execution
- Manage people and agent accounts from one admin UI
- Configure multiple LLM providers and tools
- Keep all components running locally in one container for pilots and demos

## Community Edition and Enterprise Edition

Community Edition (source-available) is for local/self-hosted collaboration and core orchestration features.

Enterprise Edition adds commercial capabilities like advanced identity, policy controls, and enterprise support.

## Quick Start (Non-Engineer Friendly)

The easiest path is the all-in-one container setup.

Run:

```bash
deploy/all-in-one/bin/quickstart.sh
```

After setup:
1. Open Automata Admin UI at `http://localhost:4000`
2. Add your first LLM provider in the UI
3. Open your Matrix client (Element/Element Web)
4. Join `main` room and send a message to `@automata`

If you can complete those steps, your collaborative agent system is live.

## Product Experience In 15 Minutes

1. Create a few users from onboarding/admin pages
2. Invite users and agents to `main` and `random`
3. Ask `@automata` to perform a real task in chat
4. Watch typing and final response directly in Matrix
5. Confirm runs and settings from the web UI
